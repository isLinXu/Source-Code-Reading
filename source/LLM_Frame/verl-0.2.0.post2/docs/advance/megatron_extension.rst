Add models with the Megatron-LM backend
=========================================

Model
-----------

The most challenging aspect to use the Megatron-LM backend is implementing
the models for training. Currently, we implement Llama model that
support data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism (also
vPP) and sequence parallelism. We also implement remove padding (sequence packing) on Llama
model, which can be found in `modeling_llama_megatron.py <https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/verl/models/llama/megatron/modeling_llama_megatron.py>`_.

To support other model, users are required to implement:

1. Implemnt a model similar to ``modeling_llama_megatron.py`` that satisfy the
   parallelism requirements of Megatron-LM. Then register your model in
   the `registry.py <https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/verl/models/registry.py>`_.
2. Checkpoint utils that can load full checkpoint (e.g.Â huggingface
   checkpoint) to partitioned models during the runtime. Then register
   your loader to ``weight_loader_registry`` in `weight_loader_registry.py <https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/verl/models/weight_loader_registry.py>`_.
3. Weight loader that synchronize the weight from Megatron to rollout
   (vLLM) model. Note that both the actor model and rollout model are
   partitioned during runtime. So, it's advisable to map the model name
   in actor model implementation. Otherwise, you may need an additional
   name mapping and even weight transformation. The weight loader implementation
   is in `megatron_weight_loaders.py <https://github.com/volcengine/verl/blob/main/verl/third_party/vllm/vllm_v_0_6_3/megatron_weight_loaders.py>`_.
