# Configuration for Ultralytics Solutions

model: "yolo11n.pt" # The Ultralytics YOLO11 model to be used (e.g., yolo11n.pt for YOLO11 nano version and yolov8n.pt for YOLOv8 nano version)

region: # Object counting, queue or speed estimation region points. Default region points are [(20, 400), (1080, 404), (1080, 360), (20, 360)]
line_width: 2 # Width of the annotator used to draw regions on the image/video frames + bounding boxes and tracks drawing. Default value is 2.
show: True # Flag to control whether to display output image or not, you can set this as False i.e. when deploying it on some embedded devices.
show_in: True # Flag to display objects moving *into* the defined region
show_out: True # Flag to display objects moving *out of* the defined region
classes: # To count specific classes. i.e, if you want to detect, track and count the person with COCO model, you can use classes=0, Default its None
up_angle: 145.0 # Workouts up_angle for counts, 145.0 is default value. You can adjust it for different workouts, based on position of keypoints.
down_angle: 90 # Workouts down_angle for counts, 90 is default value. You can change it for different workouts, based on position of keypoints.
kpts: [6, 8, 10] # Keypoints for workouts monitoring, i.e. If you want to consider keypoints for pushups that have mostly values of [6, 8, 10].
colormap: # Colormap for heatmap, Only OPENCV supported colormaps can be used. By default COLORMAP_PARULA will be used for visualization.
analytics_type: "line" # Analytics type i.e "line", "pie", "bar" or "area" charts. By default, "line" analytics will be used for processing.
json_file: # parking system regions file path.
