YOLO MagicüöÄ is an extension built on top of [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) YOLOv5, designed to provide more powerful capabilities and simpler operations for visual tasks. It introduces a variety of network modules on top of YOLOv5 and offers an intuitive web-based interface aimed at providing greater convenience and flexibility for both beginners and professionals.

## Key Features

### 1. Powerful Network Module Extensions

YOLO MagicüöÄ introduces a range of powerful network modules designed to expand the functionality of YOLOv5 and provide users with more choices and possibilities:

- **Spatial Pyramid Modules**: Includes SPP, SPPF, ASPP, SPPCSPC, SPPFCSPC, etc. These modules aim to capture targets at different spatial scales and enhance the model's visual perception.

- **Feature Fusion Structures**: We provide diverse feature fusion structures such as FPN, PAN, BIFPN, etc., designed to effectively fuse feature information from different levels, improving the model's object detection and localization performance.

- **New Backbone Networks**: YOLO MagicüöÄ supports various pre-trained backbone networks, including EfficientNet, ShuffleNet, etc. These backbone networks offer additional choices to enhance the model's performance and efficiency.

- **Rich Attention Mechanisms**: We offer various attention mechanisms that can be easily embedded into your model to enhance focus on targets and improve detection performance.

### 2. Simple and User-Friendly Web Interface

YOLO MagicüöÄ greatly simplifies the model inference process with an intuitive web-based interface. No more cumbersome command-line operations. You can easily accomplish the following tasks:

- **Image Inference**: Perform image inference and object detection with simple drag-and-drop and configuration. You can freely adjust confidence levels, thresholds, upload images, and crop areas of interest.

- **Video Inference**: TODO

## Getting Started

You can quickly get started with YOLO MagicüöÄ by following these steps:

**Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # Clone the repository
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install the environment
```

**Inference with detect.py**

`detect.py` runs inference on various data sources. It automatically downloads the latest YOLOv5 [model](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) from the [repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) and saves detection results to the `runs/detect` directory.

```bash
python detect.py --source 0  # Camera
                          img.jpg  # Image
                          vid.mp4  # Video
                          path/  # Folder
                          'path/*.jpg'  # Glob
                          'https://youtu.be/Zgi9g1ksQHc'  # YouTube
                          'rtsp://example.com/media.mp4'  # RTSP, RTMP, HTTP
```

**Web Page Inference**

Launch a web page quickly using the `Gradio`-based interface.

```bash
python detect_web.py
```

**Training**

The following command reproduces YOLOv5 results on the [COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/scripts/get_coco.sh) dataset. [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) and [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) are automatically downloaded from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases). Training times for YOLOv5n/s/m/l/x are 1/2/4/6/8 days on a V100 GPU (multi-GPU scales linearly). Use the largest `--batch-size` possible or enable YOLOv5 [auto-batching](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/5092) with `--batch-size -1`. Batch sizes shown for V100-16GB.

```bash
python train.py --data coco.yaml --epochs 300 --weights '' --cfg yolov5n.yaml  --batch-size 128
                                                                 yolov5s                    64
                                                                 yolov5m                    40
                                                                 yolov5l                    24
                                                                 yolov5x                    16
```
