# Evaluation

We implemented the evaluations for SmolVLM in [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit).
They can be run by following the instructions in their repository.

We also have our own internal evaluation scripts, they can be found in the experiments/evaluation folder. The code used for supporting those is in the m4 folder.
