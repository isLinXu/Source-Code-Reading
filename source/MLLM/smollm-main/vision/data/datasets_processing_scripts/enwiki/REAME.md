This folder contains all the slurm, bash and python scripts used to build enwiki-v1 and enwiki-v2. The numbering of the files indicates the order in which they were run.

Beware, these scripts have sometimes been used on different machines to process a portion of the shards, the changes needed to parallelize the work are not contained in the scripts in the folder  `slurm_and_bash_scripts`.
