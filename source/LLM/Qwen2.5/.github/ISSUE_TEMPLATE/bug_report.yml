        Please copy and paste any relevant log output. 
        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks. 
        If the log suggested things like
        ```
        RuntimeError: CUDA error: device-side assert triggered
        CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
        For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
        ```
        please follow the instructions and set the corresponding parameters.
