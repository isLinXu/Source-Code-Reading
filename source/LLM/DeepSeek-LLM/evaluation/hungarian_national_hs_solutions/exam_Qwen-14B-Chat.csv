"Answer the following question:
Zita's salary has been raised from $275000$ Ft to $308000$ Ft. By what percentage has Zita's salary been raised?","To find the percentage increase in Zita's salary, we can use the following formula:
percentage increase = (new amount - old amount) / old amount * 100%
Plugging in the values, we get:
percentage increase = (308000 - 275000) / 275000 * 100%
percentage increase = 33000 / 275000 * 100%
percentage increase = 0.1208 * 100%
percentage increase = 12.08%
Therefore, Zita's salary has been raised by 12.08%.",1.0

The sides of the right triangle $A B C$ are $a=7, b=24, c=25$ units long. Calculate the length of the height that belongs to the hypotenuse. Explain your answer.","We know that the length of the height that belongs to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is given by the formula $h = c \cdot \sin A$, where $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse and $A$ is the angle opposite to the side $a$.
In this case, we have $c=25$ units and $a=7$ units, so we can calculate the angle $A$ using the Pythagorean theorem:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \Rightarrow 7^2 + 24^2 = 25^2 \Rightarrow A = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{7}{25} \right) \approx 14.06^\circ$
Now we can use the formula for the height to find its length:
$h = c \cdot \sin A = 25 \cdot \sin 14.06^\circ \approx 7.07$ units
Therefore, the length of the height that belongs to the hypotenuse of the given right triangle is approximately 7.07 units.",1.0

The gradient of a line is a vector whose components are the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to the variables. In this case, the equation of the line is $5 x-y=7$, so the gradient is $\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(5 x-y), \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(5 x-y)\right) = (5, -1)$.

Function $f$ below is defined over the set of non-negative real numbers. Functions $g$ and $h$ are defined over the set of real numbers. 
$$f(x)=\sqrt{x}-2 \quad g(x)=(x-2)^{2}-3 \quad h(x)=2 \sin x$$

Since $g(x)=(x-2)^2-3$ is a square of a linear function, its minimum value is $-3$, which occurs when $x=2$.
Since $h(x)=2\sin x$ is periodic with period $2\pi$, its minimum value is $-2$, which occurs twice in every period: once in the interval $[0,\pi]$ and once in the interval $[\pi,2\pi]$.

For which function is the following statement true: The function has at least two zeros.","For $f$ to have at least two zeros, it must cross the $x$-axis at least twice. Since $f$ is a square root function, it is always increasing, so it can only cross the $x$-axis at most once. So, $f$ does not have at least two zeros.

For $g$ to have at least two zeros, it must cross the $x$-axis at least twice. Since $g$ is a quadratic function, it can have at most two real zeros. So, $g$ could have at least two zeros.

For $h$ to have at least two zeros, it must cross the $x$-axis at least twice. Since $h$ is a sine function, it has a period of $2\pi$, and it crosses the $x$-axis twice in each period. So, $h$ has at least two zeros.

"Answer the following question:
Consider the following two events:

A: Roll a fair gambling dice once, the number shown is a divisor of 24.

B: Roll a fair gambling dice twice, none of the numbers shown is a 6 .

Which of the two events has a higher probability?","

To find the probability of event A, we need to count the number of ways to roll a fair dice once and get a number that is a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Therefore, there are 8 ways to roll a number that is a divisor of 24. Since there are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a fair dice once, the probability of event A is:

P(A) = 8/6 = 4/3

To find the probability of event B, we need to count the number of ways to roll a fair dice twice and get two numbers that are not 6. There are 5 possible outcomes when rolling a fair dice once, so there are 5^2 = 25 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. To get two numbers that are not 6, we can choose any number from 1 to 5 for the first roll and any number from 1 to 5 for the second roll, except for the case where both numbers are 5. Therefore, there are 5^2 - 1 = 24 possible outcomes where both numbers are not 6. So the probability of event B is:

Therefore, event B has a higher probability than event A.",0.0

"Answer the following question:
The side of a square is 4 cm. Two line segments are drawn into this square such that they trisect one of the right angles of the square.

Calculate the area of the triangle shaded grey in the diagram.","

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the two line segments that trisect the right angle of the square. Since the side of the square is 4 cm, the length of each side of the square is also 4 cm.

Let's call the length of the two line segments that trisect the right angle of the square ""x"". Then, we can draw a right triangle with one leg of length x and the hypotenuse of length 4 cm. By the Pythagorean theorem, we know that:

x^2 + x^2 = 4^2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x^2 = 16

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x^2 = 8

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

x = ‚àö8

Now that we know the length of the two line segments, we can find the area of the triangle shaded grey in the diagram. The area of a triangle is given by:

Area = (base x height) / 2

In this case, the base of the triangle is the side of the square that is not trisected by the line segments, which is 4 cm. The height of the triangle is the length of one of the line segments, which is ‚àö8 cm.

Substituting these values into the formula for the area of a triangle, we get:

Area = (4 cm x ‚àö8 cm) / 2

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Area = 2‚àö8 cm^2

Therefore, the area of the triangle shaded grey in the diagram is 2‚àö8 cm^2.",0.0

Solve the following equations in the set of real numbers.

$$2 \cdot \sqrt{3 - x} = x + 5$$","We begin by isolating the radical term on one side of the equation, which gives us $2\sqrt{3 - x} - x = 5$. Next, we square both sides, which gives us $4(3 - x) - 4x^2 + x^2 = 25$. Simplifying, we get $-4x^2 - 4x + 13 = 0$. We can then factor this equation as $-(2x - 1)(2x + 13) = 0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{1}{2}$ or $x = -\frac{13}{2}$. However, since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we discard the solution $x = -\frac{13}{2}$.

"Answer the following question:
Solve the following equations in the set of real numbers.

$$\frac{x(x-1) + x^2(x+1)}{(x+1)(x-1)} = 2$$
Expanding the numerator and simplifying, we get:
$$\frac{x^2 - x + x^3 + x^2}{x^2 - 1} = 2$$
$$\frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - x}{x^2 - 1} = 2$$
Now we can multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator to get rid of the fraction:
$$x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 2(x^2 - 1)$$
Expanding the right-hand side and simplifying, we get:
$$x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 2x^2 - 2$$
$$x^3 - x - 2 = 0$$
This is a cubic equation, which can be solved using various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or the cubic formula. In this case, we can factor the equation as follows:

The first term of an arithmetic sequence is 18. The sum of the first six terms of the sequence is equal to the sum of the first seven terms.

Show that the sum of the first 13 terms of the sequence is 0 and calculate the 13th term of the sequence.","Let's call the common difference of the arithmetic sequence ""d"". Then, the second term of the sequence is 18 + d, the third term is 18 + 2d, and so on.

The sum of the first six terms of the sequence is:

18 + (18 + d) + (18 + 2d) + (18 + 3d) + (18 + 4d) + (18 + 5d) = 108 + 15d

The sum of the first seven terms of the sequence is:

18 + (18 + d) + (18 + 2d) + (18 + 3d) + (18 + 4d) + (18 + 5d) + (18 + 6d) = 126 + 21d

Since the sum of the first six terms is equal to the sum of the first seven terms, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

108 + 15d = 126 + 21d

Simplifying, we get:

6d = 18

d = 3

Now we can find the sum of the first 13 terms of the sequence:

18 + (18 + 3) + (18 + 2*3) + ... + (18 + 12*3) = 18 + 21 + 24 + ... + 150

This is an arithmetic series with 13 terms, first term 18, and common difference 3. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:

S = n/2 * (a1 + an)

where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. Plugging in the values, we get:

S = 13/2 * (18 + 150) = 13/2 * 168 = 1092

So the sum of the first 13 terms of the sequence is 1092.

To find the 13th term of the sequence, we can use the formula:

an = a1 + (n-1)d

To calculate the total worth of the goods produced by factory A in the next 20 years, we need to sum up the worth of the goods produced in each of these years.

The table below shows the calculated values:

| Year | Production volume of factory A (million Ft) | Production volume of factory B (million Ft) |
|------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2018 | 500                                        | 400                                         |
| 2019 | 525                                        | 424                                         |
| 2020 | 551.25                                     | 451.04                                      |
| 2021 | 580.31                                     | 482.21                                      |

As we can see from the table, the difference between the production volumes of the two factories is not getting smaller and smaller in the next couple of years. In fact, the difference is getting larger, as factory A's production volume is increasing at a faster rate than factory B's production volume.",2.5

"Answer the following question:
Magic Spheres dessert is sold in boxes that have a shape of a regular hexagon-based prism. Each edge of the regular hexagonal base is 5 cm long and the height of the box is 3 cm. The box contains 6 chocolate balls, each has a diameter of 2.8 cm.

What percentage of the volume of the box is the volume of the chocolate?","The volume of the box is given by the formula for the volume of a prism: V = Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. The area of the base is given by the formula for the area of a regular hexagon: A = 3‚àö3s^2/2, where s is the length of one edge. Plugging in the values given, we get A = 3‚àö3(5)^2/2 = 37.5‚àö3 cm^2. The volume of the box is then V = Bh = 37.5‚àö3 cm^2 * 3 cm = 112.5‚àö3 cm^3.
The volume of each chocolate ball is given by the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = 4/3œÄr^3, where r is the radius. Plugging in the value given, we get V = 4/3œÄ(1.4)^3 = 10.37 cm^3. The total volume of the 6 chocolate balls is then 6 * 10.37 cm^3 = 62.22 cm^3.
To find the percentage of the volume of the box that is the volume of the chocolate, we divide the volume of the chocolate by the volume of the box and multiply by 100: (62.22 cm^3 / 112.5‚àö3 cm^3) * 100 = 54.3%. So, the volume of the chocolate makes up approximately 54.3% of the volume of the box.",5.0
"Answer the following question:
Chocolate balls in Magic Spheres dessert are individually wrapped in either gold or red wrapping foil. The sorting machine randomly drops the chocolate balls into the boxes, the probability of a red one is $\frac{1}{3}$, the probability of a gold one is $\frac{2}{3}$, a total six chocolate balls in each box.

Calculate the probability that at least 5 of the 6 chocolate balls in a box will be wrapped in gold foil.","There are two ways in which we can have at least 5 gold balls in a box.  Either all 6 balls are gold, or there are 5 gold balls and one red ball.  The probability that all 6 balls are gold is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6=\frac{64}{729}$.  The probability that there are 5 gold balls is $\binom{6}{5}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{48}{729}$.  Therefore, the total probability is $\frac{64}{729}+\frac{48}{729}=\boxed{\frac{112}{729}}$.",4.0
"Answer the following question:
Each side of the regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is 5 cm long. The hexagon is rotated around the perpendicular bisector of side $AB$.

Calculate the volume of the resulting solid.","Let $O$ be the center of the hexagon, so that $OA=OB=OC=OD=OE=OF=5$ cm.  The radius of the sphere is 5 cm, so the volume of the sphere is \[
\frac{4}{3}\pi(5^3)=\frac{500}{3}\pi.
\]The solid consists of the part of the sphere inside the hexagonal pyramid, which we can view as a regular tetrahedron with side length 10.  The volume of a regular tetrahedron with side length $s$ is \[
\frac{1}{3}s^3.
\]Thus the volume of the solid is \[
\frac{1}{3}(10^3)-\frac{4}{3}\pi(5^3)=\boxed{375-\frac{500}{3}\pi}.
